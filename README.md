In version 2 of this program, we can implement a function to validate user input for each case. We can also build on the existing functions to support indirect conversions, such as converting from octal to hexadecimal by first converting octal to decimal, then decimal to hexadecimal. To improve usability, we can enhance the user interface by adding a menu or table for selecting conversion options. Running the program in a loop would allow multiple conversions without needing to restart it each time. Additionally, we could add functionality to save the conversion history to a file. Finally, to support larger inputs beyond typical integer limits, we can modify the program to handle user input as strings instead of integers.
